Master Client Site Blueprint: The "Metal Ministry" Protocol
Context ID: context7 Purpose: This is the definitive guide for onboarding new clients to the Multi-Tenant CMS. It documents the end-to-end workflow from "Legacy Site" to "Modern CMS-Integrated Web App".

Workflow Overview
We follow a strict 5-Phase Protocol for every new client site:

Conversion: HTML/PHP → Next.js Structure
Migration: Static Content → Supabase Database
Redesign: Basic Layout → Premium Industrial Design
Integration: Standalone → Multi-Tenant CMS Connected
Optimization: Dynamic → Static SEO Powerhouse
Phase 1: Legacy Conversion (The "Lift")
Goal: Initialize a modern Next.js 14+ codebase and identify assets from the old site.

Steps:
Scaffolding: Clone the client-site template (this repo).
Asset Extraction: Copy public images/PDFs from the legacy site to public/.
Route Mapping: Identify the key pages from the old site (Home, About, Contact, Product Categories).
🤖 AI Prompt for Phase 1
"I am starting a new client site called '[Client Name]'.

Clone the current client-site structure as a baseline.
Analyze the provided legacy HTML files (or URL) to understand their navigation structure.
Create a route map: List which legacy URLs map to which Next.js App Router paths."
Phase 2: Data Migration (The "Shift")
Goal: Move hardcoded content into the shared Supabase post table.

Architecture:
Table: public.post
Discriminators:
company_id: UUID (isolates client data).
type: 'product' | 'blog'.
Steps:
Parsing: Write a script (using cheerio + turndown) to read legacy HTML.
Cleaning: Extract Title, Content (convert to Clean HTML or Markdown), and Meta Description.
Insertion: Bulk insert into Supabase using the new company_id.
🤖 AI Prompt for Phase 2
"I have a folder of legacy HTML product pages.

Write a Node.js script using cheerio to extract the 'Product Title', 'Description', and 'Specifications Table' from each file.
Generate a JSON manifest of this data.
Create a seeding script to insert this JSON into Supabase post table with company_id='[NEW_UUID]' and type='product'."
Phase 3: Redesign (The "Shine")
Goal: Apply the "Premium Industrial" design language.

Design Tokens:
Theme: Industrial (Dark/Light mode support, but heavy use of White/Gray/Blue).
Glassmorphism: Used on cards and overlays.
Typography: Clean Sans-Serif (Inter/Roboto).
Components:
HeroSlider
: Full-width, high-impact imagery.
ProductCatalog
: Grid view with hover effects.
StickySidebar: "Quick Contact" permanently visible.
🤖 AI Prompt for Phase 3
"Apply the 'Metal Ministry' Premium Industrial theme to this new site.

Update tailwind.config.ts with [Client Primary Color].
Ensure the 
Sidebar
 is sticky and contains the 'Quick Contact' widget.
Style the Homepage Product Grid to be symmetrical and fully responsive.
Use framer-motion for subtle entrance animations on the Hero section."
Phase 4: CMS Integration (The "Connect")
Goal: Enable the Admin Panel to control this site.

Configuration:
Environment: Set NEXT_PUBLIC_COMPANY_ID in .env.local.
Filtering: Ensure all Supabase queries strictly filter by this ID.
Products: .eq('type', 'product')
Blogs: .eq('type', 'blog')
🤖 AI Prompt for Phase 4
"Connect this site to the CMS.

Set the NEXT_PUBLIC_COMPANY_ID to '[UUID]'.
Verify that 
src/app/products/page.tsx
 fetches ONLY products for this ID.
Verify that 
src/app/blogs/page.tsx
 fetches ONLY blog posts for this ID.
Test that creating a post in the Admin Panel appears instantly on this site."
Phase 5: SEO Optimization (The "Rank")
Goal: Google Ranking Dominance.

Checklist:
Static Generation (ISR):
Use 
generateStaticParams
 in [slug]/page.tsx.
Set revalidate = 3600 (1 hour).
Metadata:
Dynamic 
generateMetadata
 fetching meta_title and meta_description from DB.
Structured Data (JSON-LD):
Inject BlogPosting schema on Blog pages.
Inject 
Product
 schema on Product pages.
🤖 AI Prompt for Phase 5
"Optimize the site for SEO.

Implement 
generateStaticParams
 for both Product and Blog dynamic routes to ensure they build as static HTML.
Add JSON-LD Structured Data: BlogPosting for blogs and 
Product
 for products.
Ensure the 
Header
 includes semantic nav links and the proper internal linking structure."

Session Context Summary: Metal Ministry CMS Multi-Tenant Project
1. Project Overview
We are building a Multi-Tenant Headless CMS where a single Admin Panel manages multiple detached Client Sites.

Admin Panel: cms-task (Next.js, Supabase)
Client Site Template: cms-task/client-site (Next.js, Tailwind, Framer Motion)
Database: Supabase (shared post table structure).
2. Key Achievements in This Session
A. Refined "Metal Ministry" Client Site
Sticky Sidebar: Fixed CSS issues to make the sidebar (with "Quick Contact") permanently visible without internal scrolling.
Homepage: Balanced product grid and redesigned "Request Quote" CTA with glassmorphism.
Flanges Links: Fixed broken sidebar links by mapping them to correct long-form slugs.
B. Implemented Full "Blogs" Feature
Database: Added type column to post table (check (type in ('product', 'blog'))).
Admin Panel: Updated PostForm to include a "Content Type" selector and updated actions.ts.
Client Site:
Navigation: Added "BLOGS" link to Header.
Products Page: Filters post table by .eq('type', 'product').
Blogs Page: Created /blogs to list posts where .eq('type', 'blog').
Blog Post Page: Created /blogs/[slug] with Static Generation (ISR) and JSON-LD Schema for SEO.
C. Created Master Documentation
Artifact: client_site_blueprint.md
Location: C:\Users\Vivek\.gemini\antigravity\brain\813e7c22-e2ec-4731-9781-bd4de5d7a075\client_site_blueprint.md
Purpose: Defines the 5-Phase Protocol (Lift, Shift, Shine, Connect, Rank) for replicating this success across 15+ more client sites.
3. Current System State
Supabase: post table has type column.
Admin: Fully functional for creating Products AND Blogs.
Client Site: Fully functional, separates products/blogs, high-performance SEO.
4. Next Steps for New Session
Replication: Use the client_site_blueprint.md to start the next client site (e.g., "Steel Titans").
Prompting: Provide the "Phase 1 Prompt" from the blueprint to the AI to begin cloning and asset extraction.


Based on our roadmap and architectural decisions, here is the Project Objective & Vision when we started:

🎯 The Core Objective
To build a scalable Multi-Tenant Headless CMS Factory that allows us to rapidly modernize legacy industrial websites into high-performance Next.js applications.

🔑 Key Requirements & Vision
The "One-to-Many" Architecture (Multi-Tenancy)
Vision: We didn't want to build 15 separate Admin Panels for 15 clients.
Solution: A single, unified Admin Dashboard (cms-task) that manages all content for all clients, separated strictly by company_id.
The "Lift & Shift" Strategy (Legacy Migration)
Vision: Take old, clunky HTML/PHP sites (like Metal Ministry) and modernize them without losing their valuable data or SEO ranking.
Solution: A "phase-wise" protocol to parse legacy HTML, clean the data, and migrate it to a structured Supabase database.
Factory-Like Scalability
Vision: Creating a new client site should take days, not weeks.
Solution: A standardized "Client Site Template" (the Blueprint) that can be cloned, branded, and deployed rapidly. This eliminates repetitive setup work.
SEO Dominance
Vision: The new sites must outperform the old ones on Google.
Solution: Next.js App Router with Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR). This gives the speed of a static site (HTML) with the flexibility of a dynamic CMS.
🚀 How It Should Work (The Flow)
Sales: You sign a new client (e.g., "Steel Titans").
Setup: You run the "Phase 1" prompt to clone the template and extract their old data.
Admin: You give the client access to the shared Admin Panel to manage their own blogs/products.
Result: They get a premium, fast, modern website; You get a maintainable, unified codebase.
